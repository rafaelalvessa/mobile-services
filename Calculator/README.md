# MVC Calculator

## Aims

Main Expectation: Be able to program a simple calculator using the MVC (Model
View Controller) pattern.

The aims of this project are:

- Be familiar with concepts of MVC programming pattern.
- Be familiar with graphical operations in Android.
- Practice on MVC programming with calculator as an example.

## MVC Concept

The MVC is an abbreviation of Model, View, and Controller. It is a programming
style that widely used in program design and implementation.

The MVC programming style is highly recommended for its conciseness structure,
flexibility, and scalability.

This pattern divides objects in your program into 3 'camps': Model, View, and
Controller:

- Model: what your application is (but not how it is displayed).
- Controller: how your model is presented to the user (the UI logic).
- View: all the minions (e.g. Label, Button, etc.) of your controllers.

In this MVC calculator, the model is the Calculator Brain; the controller is the
View Controller; view includes the Buttons, Labels and so on.
