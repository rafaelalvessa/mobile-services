# Accelerometer Application

## Aims

Main Expectation: Be able to build up a simple application that can recognise
whether the user is in stationary status or dynamic status using the in-built
accelerometer.

The aims of this project are:

- Be familiar with embedded Android smartphone accelerometer sensor.
- Think of the potential application of accelerometer in mobile service.
- Be familiar with how Events and Actions work in Android.
- Practice Android programming with accelerometer as an example.

## Accelerometer Basics

An accelerometer is a device that measure magnitude and direction of the gravity
experienced by a subject. There are single- and multi-axis models of
accelerometer that differ with each other in terms of different vector quantity
it supports. The smartphone in-built 3D-accelerometer is of interest in this
project, since it can be used to sense whether the subject has stationary or
dynamic status.

There are three axes that an Android accelerometer supports to detect. The value
of each axis corresponds to the acceleration generated in each vector direction.
This smartphone in-built accelerometer is very useful in detecting the
acceleration variations generated during user motion.
